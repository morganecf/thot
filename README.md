# thot
Chrome extension that helps you take and save notes on the articles you're reading. Thoth was the Egyptian deity tasked with note-taking. He also maintained the universe and judged the dead. Who doesn't like judging the dead? Thot is a lexical bastardization of "thought," which is kind of what a note tries to encapsulate. So, a thought-inscribing chrome extension.
